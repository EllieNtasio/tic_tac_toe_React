This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.
Through this project, I learned a lot about React concepts, hooks, and the fundamentals of building interactive UIs.

Features: Interactive Gameplay-Two-player game (X and O) where players take turns,
 Responsive Design-The game works on both desktop and mobile devices,
 Winning Logic-The game detects a winner or a draw based on the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe,
 Restart Game-You can reset the game and play again at any time.

What I Learned:
How to set up a React project from scratch.
Managing state in React using hooks like useState.
Conditional rendering and updating the UI based on user actions.
Handling events like user clicks to update the game board.
Component-based design, breaking the UI into smaller reusable parts.
Basics of CSS to style and position elements.
